Its also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing.

Archery has in built plugin for OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) Scanner and you can utilize to perform automated way scanning on your web applications.

### ZAP Running in Daemon Mode

ZAP Scanner path

```bash
# Windows

C:\Program Files\OWASP\Zed Attack Proxy

# Linux

/usr/share/zaproxy/

# Mac OS

/Applications/OWASP\ ZAP.app/Contents/Java/

```

You can run ZAP scanner in daemon mode and configure into Archery ZAP setting module.

```bash
# Windows

zap.bat -daemon -host 0.0.0.0 -port 8080 -config api.disablekey=true -config api.addrs.addr.name=.* -config api.addrs.addr.regex=true

# Others

zap.sh -daemon -host 0.0.0.0 -port 8080 -config api.disablekey=true -config api.addrs.addr.name=.* -config api.addrs.addr.regex=true
```

Archery uses ZAP Scanner API in order to trigger scans in ZAP. If you run ZAP in daemon mode, the ZAP API end points are exposed on your localhost `127.0.0.1` or your system IP.

You can test by accessing ``` http://127.0.0.1:8080/ ``` OR ``` http://your-system-IP:8080/ ```
