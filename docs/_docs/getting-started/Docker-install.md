Deploying with Docker is the easiest and fastest method of getting started. No prerequisites are required other than an modern version of Docker.

```bash

# Clone ArcherySec
$ git clone https://github.com/archerysec/archerysec.git

# Move to archerysec folder
$ cd archerysec

# Build docker container
$ docker-compose up --build

```
